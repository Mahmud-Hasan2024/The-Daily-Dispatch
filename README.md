## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Activation

- User signup, login and logout flows.
- **Email activation**: new users are created as inactive; an activation email (token-based) is sent via signals. Users must activate before logging in.

### 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Roles implemented with **Django Groups**: `Admin`, `Editor`, `Reporter`, `Moderator`, `Subscriber`.
- Role helpers and checks live in `users.utils` (e.g. `is_admin`, `is_editor`, `is_reporter`).
- Views use `@user_passes_test` and custom decorators to restrict access to dashboards and CRUD endpoints.

### 📰 Article Management

- `Article` model supports `pending` / `published` states.
- Authors (Admin/Editor/Reporter) can create/update/delete articles depending on role and ownership rules:

  - Reporters’ articles default to `pending`.
  - Admins/Editors can approve (publish) articles.

- Article images supported with `ImageField` and a default image (`article_images/breaking.webp`).
- Article slug is autogenerated from the title.

### 💬 Comments

- Full comment CRUD: create, update, delete.
- Comments are tied to `Article` and `User`, with timestamps.

### ✉️ Signals & Emails

- Signals auto-send:

  - Account activation email when a user is created.
  - Notification email to the author when their article status changes to `published`.

- Email sending uses Django’s `send_mail` — configure your SMTP settings in `settings.py`.

### 👤 Profiles

- `Profile` model (OneToOne with User) stores phone number, profile image (default `profile_images/default.png`) and bio.
- Profile is created automatically via post-save signals.

### 🧪 DB Seeding

- A custom management command seeds:

  - Groups (roles), users, profiles, categories, articles (with fetched images), and comments.

- The seed script applies publishing rules: Admin/Editor articles are published; Reporter articles are pending.

## 🛠️ Local Setup (Run locally)

1.  **Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahmud-Hasan2024/The-Daily-Dispatch.git
cd The-Daily-Dispatch
```

2.  **Create & activate venv**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3.  **Install**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.  **Environment / settings**

- Create a `.env` or set environment variables for:

  - `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  - Database (if using PostgreSQL in production)
  - Email: `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
  - `FRONTEND_URL` used in activation email generation (e.g. `http://localhost:8000` for dev)

- For local development email, add to `settings.py`:

```py
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
```

so emails print to console instead of sending.

5.  **Migrations**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

6.  **Create superuser**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7.  **(Optional) Seed DB**

- You included a custom management command to seed users, roles, articles, images and comments.
- Run it like:

```bash
python manage.py <seed_command_name>
```

> The exact command name is the filename of the script located at `management/commands/<your_command>.py`. (E.g. `python manage.py seed_db` if file is `seed_db.py`.)

8.  **Run server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## ⚙️ Production & Deployment Notes

- Hosted live on **Render** (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for links and demo credentials).
- Production DB: **PostgreSQL** (Render-managed).
- Ensure these best practices when deploying:

  - `DEBUG = False`
  - Use secure `SECRET_KEY` from env
  - Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  - Serve static files (e.g., `collectstatic`) and configure `MEDIA_ROOT`/`MEDIA_URL`
  - Use a real SMTP provider or email relay for activation and notification emails
  - Do not commit secrets (remove `db.sqlite3` and `.env` from git; add them to `.gitignore`)

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Remove `db.sqlite3` from the repository and list it in `.gitignore` before opening the project publicly.
- Keep `SECRET_KEY` and email credentials out of the repo (use environment variables).
- Consider enabling login rate-limits and account lockouts for production.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (ideas)

- Add bookmarking / RSVP features (ManyToMany relationship between users & articles/events).
- Full-text search, tagging & filtering for articles.
- Comments moderation queue and spam prevention.
- REST API (Django REST Framework) implementation for articles and comments.
